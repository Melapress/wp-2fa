== Installing WP 2FA ==

###From within WordPress

1.  Navigate to ‘Plugins > Add New’
2.  Search for ‘WP 2FA’
3.  Install & activate WP 2FA from your Plugins page
  
###Manually

1.  Download the plugin from the WordPress plugins repository
2.  Unzip the zip file and upload the folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3.  Activate the WP 2FA plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The first-time install wizard allows you to setup 2FA on your website and for your user within seconds.
2. The wizards make setting up 2FA very easy, so even non technical users can setup 2FA without requiring help.
3. You can require users to enable 2FA and also give them a grace period to do so.
4. Users can also use one-time codes via email as a two-factor authentication method.
5. You can use policies to require users to instantly set up and use 2FA, so the next time they login they will be prompted with this.
6. You can give users a grace period until they configure 2FA. You can also specify what should the plugin do once the grace period is over.
7. It is recommended for all users to also generate backup codes, in case they cannot access the primary device.
8. In the user profile users only have a few 2FA options, so it is not confusing for them and everything is self explanatory.
